A Small Octocat Sign
====================

This small sign is designed to have 4 small disc magnets glued in the back to
make a small magnet. Print the [complete sign](stl/complete-sign.stl), and glue
some small disc magnets in the back. Looks best if you swap filament half way
through the print so the octocat is colored differently.
